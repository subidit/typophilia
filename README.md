## Key rules 

- The typographic quality of your document is determined largely by how the body text looks.
- The appearance of the body text is determined primarily by these four typographic choices:
1. Font choice - avoid default fonts.
2. Point size - 10–12 pt for print. 15–25 px on web.
3. Line spacing - 120–145% of the point size.
4. Line length - 45–90 characters per line. 

### Visual Hierarchy

There are a variety of elements that work together to create a typographic hierarchy, including:

1. Size & Weight
2. Positioning & Alignment
3. Color 
4. Contrast
5. Case
6. Typeface


## Terminology 

1. **Grotesk**: The common German name for sans serif faces, as opposed to “Antiqua” which means serif face.
2. **Antiqua**: The common German and Scandinavian names for serif faces, The Scandinavian name is “Antikva”.
3. **Roman**: Standard type style or regular weight of an upright typeface
4. **Diacritics**: A diacritic is an ancillary mark or sign added to a letter. Accents are one type of diacritics. 
5. **Dingbats**: Decorative symbols and characters that are generally not included in a font or character set, including boxes, bullets, arrows, pointers, and other characters. Often made up into their own font.
6. **Oldstyle figures**: Numbers that have different heights, some aligning to the baseline, some below. Oldstyle figures harmonize well with lowercase letters. Using oldstyle figures helps keep the numbers from standing out too much and disturbing the overall flow of the typography on the page. Oldstyle figures can be *proportional* or *tabular*.
7. **Lining figures (LF)**: Numbers that rest on the baseline, and are usually the same height as capital letters. Lining figures can be tabular or proportional.
8. **Font**: particular size or style of a typeface, say 10 point regular or 24 point italic.
9. **Typeface**: the specific design of the letters, say Times New Roman or Baskerville.
10. **Glyph**: individual symbols of the typeface, say  letter, number, punctuation mark, accented variations, etc. 
11. **Baseline, Cap Line, x-Height**
12. **Tracking** is Letter-Spacing. 
13. **Kerning** is spacing between two specific letters, eg. LT, VA or To.
14. **Leading** is Line-Spacing.
15. Fixed-width is **Monospaced**.
16. Italics is *not* same as Slanted or Oblique.

### Anatomy

(Example letters depends on the typeface, may not be visible here.)
1. **Aperture**: partially enclosed, somewhat rounded negative space (n, c, C, s, S, e) 
2. **Apex**: in the capital ‘A’.
3. **Arm**: A horizontal or upward, sloping stroke that does not connect. (r, E, F, T, V)
4. **Ascender**: partially enclosed, somewhat rounded negative space (b, d, f, h, k) 
5. **Axis / Stress**: An imaginary line drawn from top to bottom of a glyph bisecting the upper and
lower strokes is the axis. 
1. **Ball / Teardrop Terminal** (‘f’) 
2. **Beak**: decorative stroke at the end of the arm (More pronounced serifs of E, F)
3. **Bowl**: The curved part of the character that encloses the circular or curved parts (or counter) (d,b,o,g,D,B) 
4. **Counter**: The open or negative space in a fully or partly closed area within a letter. Bowl + Aperture letters.
5.  **Cross Stroke**: (f/t) 
6.  **Crossbar**:  horizontal stroke across the middle of uppercase ‘A’ and ‘H’.
7.  **Crotch**: (V/W/Y) - where two strokes meet and form an interior angle.
8.  **Descender**: Any part in a lowercase letter that extends below the baseline (g, j, p, q, y, etc.) 
9.  **Double-storey**: A double-storey ‘a’ or ‘g’ has two counters.
10. **Ear**: Typically found on the lowercase double storey ‘g’, an ear is a finishing stroke usually on the upper right side of the bowl.
11. **Eye**: Enclosed space in a lowercase ‘e’. 
17. **Finial / Taper** 
18. **Flag**: The horizontal stroke at the top of the numeral ‘5’.
19. **Gadzook**: An embellishment that connects the letters in a ligature but is not originally part of either letter. 
20. **Hook**: of ‘f’,‘J’ and ‘j’. 
21. **Ink trap** 
22. **Leg**: (‘K’, ‘k’ and ‘R’) 
23. **Ligature**: (‘fi’, ‘fl’, ‘ff’, ‘ffl’) 
24. **Loop/Lobe**: In some double-storey ‘g’
25. **Neck / Link**: The link connecting the top and bottom bowls of some lowercase ‘g’. 
26. **Shoulder**: arm that is connected on both ends (‘h’, ‘m’, ‘n’) 
27. **Spine**: The main curve in ‘S’ and ‘s’. 
28. **Spur**: Small protruding part on uppercase ‘G’.
29. **Stem**
30. **Swash**: An elegant extension on a letter form, either a modification of an existing part or an added-on part.
31. **Tail**: of an uppercase ‘Q’. 
32. **Tittle**: The dot on the ‘i’ and the ‘j’.
33. **Vertex**: The point at the bottom (or top) of a character where two strokes meet, for example the ‘v’, ‘V’, ‘w’, ‘W’ etc.

## Formats

1. **TrueType (.ttf):** Developed by Apple and Microsoft in the late 1980s, TrueType fonts are widely used and supported by both operating systems. They contain both the font outlines and the font instructions for rendering glyphs.

2. **OpenType (.otf):** A more versatile and modern font format developed by Adobe and Microsoft. OpenType fonts can contain more glyphs (characters), support more languages, include advanced typographic features, and have better cross-platform compatibility. OpenType fonts can also be either TrueType-based or PostScript-based.

3. **PostScript Type 1 (.pfb, .pfm):** Developed by Adobe, PostScript fonts were widely used in the past. They contain vector outlines of characters and were commonly used for printing. However, they've largely been replaced by OpenType fonts due to their limitations.

4. **Web Open Font Format (WOFF, WOFF2):** These formats are specifically optimized for web use. WOFF and WOFF2 are compressed font formats that help improve web page loading times by reducing file sizes. They are based on OpenType or TrueType fonts and are widely supported by modern web browsers.

5. **Embedded OpenType (EOT):** Another font format developed by Microsoft specifically for Internet Explorer. EOT fonts were created to address some security and licensing issues for web fonts but have been largely replaced by WOFF and WOFF2 formats.

6. **SVG Fonts (.svg):** Based on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), these fonts use XML to describe glyphs, and each character is defined using vector graphics. SVG fonts are less common and have been largely superseded by other formats due to limitations in features and compatibility.

7. **Variable Fonts:** Variable fonts contain multiple variations of a typeface (weight, width, slant, etc.) within a single file. They enable real-time adjustment of these attributes along a continuous spectrum, allowing for infinite possibilities of styles and weights. They offer dynamic control over attributes like weight, width, slant, and optical size, allowing smoother transitions between styles and enabling designers to fine-tune typography for various screen sizes, resolutions, and environments. They also reduce the number of HTTP requests and file downloads on the web, enhancing performance by delivering multiple font styles in a single file.
